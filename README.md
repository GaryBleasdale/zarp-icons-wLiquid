## üí° Why I made this theme

I could never find an icon theme I was fully satisfied with, so I ended up creating one. I wanted it to be as consistent with the style as possible, therefore any icon is made on a `100*100px` canvas with `5px` wide strokes. For now, icon colors are optimized for darker themes.

The theme mostly consist of icons inspired by open source icon projects that I redrew to fit the consistency rules stated above.

It is primarily for my personal use, but I'd be more than happy to share it with others to use!
